# Python-Based Binary Calcualtor

## What is it?
This is a calculator that aims to emulate a calculator on the lowest possible level using virtual logic gates.
Current functionality allows for Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication

It was created for a university coursework which required heavy user input validation, hence the extensive use of input 
checking and sanitation. 

### How to try it out 
Python 3 is required, however no 3rd party dependancies exist to allow maximum intercompatibility

To run it:
```
python3 bytecalculator.py
```
